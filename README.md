# Bufi
Bocal User-Friendly Interface

# Description
Bufi makes managing your Epitech repositories easier.
It includes the functionality of the `blih` command-line tool, adding a nice graphical interface and some time saving features.

# Why Bufi?
  * Bufi conveniently displays your repositories and replaces complex commands by inputs and buttons.
  * You do not have to enter your credentials for every single operation. Bufi can even save your session between launches.
  * It has some handy security/confirmation features ~~you won't find in `blih`~~.

# Setup
  1. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python 3
  1. Navigate to the repository folder and run `sudo ./setup`
  1. Done! You may now launch Bufi by running `./main.py`
